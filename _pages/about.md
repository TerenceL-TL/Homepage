I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn). My research interest includes unified understanding and generation and multimodal video reasoning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Baotian Hu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/hubaotian) of TMG-Group from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology.
